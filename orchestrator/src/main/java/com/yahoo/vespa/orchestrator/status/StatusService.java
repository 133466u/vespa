     * Returns a mutable host status registry for a locked application instance. All operations performed on

     * operations (e.g. read-then-write) are guaranteed to be consistent.
     *
     * Some limitations/caveats apply for certain implementations, and since clients of this API must be aware of
     * these limitations/caveats when using those implementations, they are expressed here, at interface level
     * rather than at implementation level, because the interface represents the lowest common denominator
     * of guarantees offered by implementations. Specifically, it is the zookeeper-based implementation's semantics
     * that "leak through" in this spec. Now, to the specific caveats:
     *
     * Locking this application instance only guarantees that the holder is the only one that can mutate host statuses
     * for the application instance.
     * It is _not_ safe to assume that there is only one entity holding the lock for a given application instance
     * reference at any given time.
     *
     * You cannot have multiple locks in a single thread, even if they are for different application instances,
     * (i.e. different HostStatusRegistry instances). (This is due to a limitation in SessionFailRetryLoop.)
     *
     * While read-then-write-operations are consistent (i.e. the current value doesn't change between the read
     * and the write), it is possible that the lock is lost before it is explicitly released by the code. In
     * this case, subsequent mutating operations will fail, but previous mutating operations are NOT rolled back.
     * This may leave the registry in an inconsistent state (as judged by the client code).
